Operations Management - Forecasting House Price In IOWA
----------------

Our objective is to know what factors are contributing significantly to the selling price of the houses and come up with a robust model taking all factors into consideration, to predict home prices in the region.

All statistical methods rely on initial assumption of data being normally distributed and the relationship is indeed linear. Hence before applying any statistical method, it should be confirmed whether the data is normally distributed or not. 

• 2-Year Moving Average - The main drawback of this technique is it doesn’t consider all factors into account which might affect the sales price of a property.
 
• Regression technique -  To build a model which would take all factors into consideration and the predict the sales price more accurately.

• In the final regression model we see that the adjusted R-squared value is 0.82 which means 82% of total variability in price is explained by all these variables.

• We have used the equation above to calculate the sales price for all the years. The MPSE came to be 0.69%.

• The MPSE now is lower than that of the moving average method (0.7% as compared to 0.89%), indicating that Regression is the more accurate method to predict home sales of IOWA.
